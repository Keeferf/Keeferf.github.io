          Hi, I'm Keefer Belanger, a recent Software Engineering graduate from
          Carleton University with a passion for building innovative and
          user-friendly software solutions. I have experience in programming
          languages like
          <strong>Java, C, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and TypeScript</strong>, and
          I'm proficient in frameworks such as
          <strong>React, and Spring Boot</strong> and platforms like
          <strong>Azure</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          My coursework has equipped me with a strong foundation in
          <strong>algorithms, data structures, and software architecture</strong
          >, and I've worked on projects ranging from web application
          development to server-side system design. I thrive in collaborative
          environments and have experience leading cross-functional teams to
          deliver projects on time and within scope.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of coding, I enjoy building computers, exploring new
          technologies, and traveling. I'm always eager to learn and take on new
          challenges!
