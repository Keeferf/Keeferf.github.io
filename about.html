          Hi, I'm Keefer Belanger, a Software Engineering student at Carleton
          University with a passion for building innovative and user-friendly
          software solutions. I have experience in programming languages like
          <strong>Java, C, Python, JavaScript, and TypeScript</strong>, and I'm
          proficient in frameworks such as <strong>React</strong> and platforms
          like <strong>Microsoft Azure</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          My coursework has equipped me with a strong foundation in
          <strong>algorithms, data structures, and software architecture</strong
          >, and I've worked on projects ranging from mobile app development to
          web application replication. I thrive in collaborative environments
          and have experience leading cross-functional teams to deliver projects
          on time and within scope.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of coding, I enjoy building computers, exploring new
          technologies, and traveling. I'm always eager to learn and take on new
          challenges!
