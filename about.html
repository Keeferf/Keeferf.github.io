  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    Hi, I'm Keefer Belanger, a Software Engineering student at Carleton
    University with a passion for building innovative and user-friendly software
    solutions. I have experience in programming languages like
    <strong>Java, C, Python, JavaScript, and TypeScript</strong>, and I'm
    proficient in frameworks such as <strong>React</strong> and platforms like
    <strong>Microsoft Azure</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    My coursework has equipped me with a strong foundation in
    <strong>algorithms, data structures, and software architecture</strong>, and
    I've worked on projects ranging from mobile app development to web
    application replication. I thrive in collaborative environments and have
    experience leading cross-functional teams to deliver projects on time and
    within scope.
  </p>
  <p>
    Outside of coding, I enjoy building computers, exploring new technologies,
    and traveling. I'm always eager to learn and take on new challenges!
