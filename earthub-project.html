      <h3>Brief:</h3>
      <p id="project-brief">
        Built a Java-based elevator simulation, featuring robust system design,
        UML documentation, and a polished presentation to showcase key
        engineering decisions. This project simulates the changing of floors,
        elevator faults on any of the floors, and timing changes between the
        usages of the elevetor. This is all done through the use of schedulers
        and commucation of different IPs, the system also includes a graphical
        user interface (GUI) to show the simulation.
